# Project

Trying NLP using neural networks to predict the sentiment of general movie reviews data-set using NLTK, Python, TFLearn (Tensorflow). Later on I have also implemented this project to accept user input on movie review and predict its sentiment in real time

# Future Scope

Can be improved by training on more complex models and larger data-set like Resnet 50,100,150 and combination of LSTM as well.
